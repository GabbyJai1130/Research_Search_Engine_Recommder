# Research_Search_Engine_Recommder

This is a personal project in which I build a program to search and filter restaurants in Hong Kong based on user preference. 
In addition, an item-to-item collaborative based recommender system is designed to recommend restaurants based on user preference

The restaurant information is extracted from OpenRice, where it is an equivalent website to Yelp for Hong Kong restaurants

## File description:

<b> linksFinder.py </b> - A Python class that scraps all restaurant links on OpenRice 

<b>  searchEngine.py </b> - a Python based search engine for users to search and filter restaurants

<b>  main.py </b> - the main script for running the above files
